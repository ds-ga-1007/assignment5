1. I change the raw_input() to input();

2.  (1)modules: such as import os - top level
    (2)class: such as class game in game.py  - mid level
    (3)function - lower level 

3. names in class Game are good meaningful names with comments.


   bad function names are as following:

    def __repr__(self):
      

    def __call__(self, arg=None):
     

    def __getattr__(self, name):
       
4.  def make_object(dictionary, klass, n):
    if n not in dictionary:
        dictionary[n] = obj = klass()
        obj.n = n
    return dictionary[n]

    do the one thing;

    def section series do multiple things

5. score_and_exit


6. Not found

7.  In function loop(), try and catch EOFException
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        loop()
    except EOFError:
        pass

8. Class Data

9. Yes

10. def __repr__(self):
        """Run this command and return the message that results."""
        output = self.game.do_command(self.words)
        return output.rstrip('\n') + '\n'

    def __call__(self, arg=None):
        """Return a compound command of several words, like `get(keys)`."""
        if arg is None:
            return self
        words = arg.words if isinstance(arg, ReprTriggeredPhrase) else (arg,)
        return ReprTriggeredPhrase(self.game, self.words + words)


     here the author could use meaningful names instead of comments

11.class Hint(object):
    """A hint offered if the player loiters in one area too long."""

    turns_needed = 0
    turn_counter = 0
    penalty = 0
    question = None
    message = None
    used = False

    def __init__(self):
        self.rooms = []

12. yes
