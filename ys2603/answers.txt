\f0\fs24 \cf0 1. In line 37 of adventure.py, raw_input(\'91>\'92) was changed into input(\'91>\'92). After the change the game could be run normally.\
\
2. Three main stuctural techniques used:\
a. Modules: in the adventure.py, the author imported play.py to increased the readability of the program. Also, the author added unittest modules to increased the testability, both of which are very important aspects of a clean code.\
\
b. Classes: in model.py, the author used classes to organize the code, which again make the code easier to understand. In the same time, the classes Move, Room, word, etc. represent major game components.\
\
c.combination of both. My saved game \'93adve\'94 can be resumed as a result of author\'92s class/modular programing techniques. The game state is separated and the game can be revisited anytime.\
\
3. \
In data.py and model.py, many variables and class names are meaningful. For example, in game.py variables names such as treasures_not_found, dwarves_killed, and in model.py, classes names such as Dwarf, Message and Hint are very meaningful: the classes are just nouns and the variables are descriptive. There are some meaningless names, for example, in data.py, make_object(dictionary, klass, n), the n can be anything, and def section1(data, n, *etc), section 1 is also meaningless.\
\
4. \
Do one thing functions: in play.py, def resume(savefile, quiet=False) just restarts the game; in model.py, def is_aboveground(self) returns a different score to test if player above the ground.\
\
Do more than one thing functions: def move_to(self, newloc=None), and def section3(data, x, y, *verbs).\
\
5.\
In game.py, def move_to(self, newloc=None) has side effects. The function not only describes the location of the player, but also moves the player to a new location.\
\
6.\
In game.py, from \'93self.turns += 1\'94 to \'93self.dispatch_command(words)\'94 is a repeated code(lines 453-499). This code can be written using a function.\
\
7.\
Yes, there is \'93try/except\'94 handling. In adventure.py: \
if __name__ == "__main__":\
    try:\
        loop()\
    except EOFError:\
        pass\

\
This is an abnormal error message I got after I tried to restart my saved game \'93adve\'94.\
\
8.\
Yes. In game.py, the class \'93Game\'94 covers the majority part of the functions of the game, such as scoring, status of the player etc,. It is clearly more than one functionalities.\
\
9.\
Class Room(object) is the most not cohesive one. 13 attributes are created, but .is_light is used.\
\
Class Object(object) is not cohesive neither. 10 attributes are created, but only self.names, self.rooms, self.toting are used.\
\
10.\
In game.py, class Game(Data) has many unnesseary comments. For example, look_complaints = 3  # how many times to "SORRY, BUT I AM NOT ALLOWED..."\
full_description_period = 5  # how often we use a room's full description\
There are also useful comments at the beginning of game.py. For example,\
\'93# Numeric comments scattered through this file refer to FORTRAN line\
# numbers, for those comparing this file and `advent.for`; so "#2012"\
# refers to FORTRAN line number 2012\'94. For a reader who has no idea of FORTRAN, she can look it up using helpful resources.\
\
11.\
In play.py, the three functions are well defined in vertical formatting, very readable and understandable, with some triple quote comments added. \
\

Ran 15 tests in 4.658s\
\
FAILED (failures=1)\
Above is the result of running the test if uncommenting some test code in test_walk.py.\
\
Fast is met for a relatively quick run of 4.658 seconds;\
Independent is not met because the test_walk.py failed due to running tests.addTests(doctest.DocFileSuite('walkthrough1.txt')) and/or tests.addTests(doctest.DocFileSuite('walkthrough2.txt\'92)), but seceded if not uncommenting;\
Repeatable is met because all tests can be run repeatedly;\
Timely is not met because the test was run after public release of the program.\
