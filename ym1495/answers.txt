1. When I tried to run adventure.py, it returned an error on raw_input. Thus 
in adventure.py, line 37, I changed raw_input() into input(). And then game began.

2. three main techniques:
a)modular programming: adventure.py adapts multiple modules from time, play and game.
b)classes: each module breaks down into multiple classes.
c)tests: it also adds unit test modules to help test the codes.

b) not so meaningful names: in game.py there are obj.prop, self.objects_here, clock1 and clock2 not so meaning ful
